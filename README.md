# Inflamed-Tumor-Identification
A Novel Data Integration Method Identifies Inflamed Tumors from Single-Cell RNAseq Data and Differentiates Cell Type Specific Markers of Immune cell Infiltration

Purpose: Although the correlates of inflamed cancers in bulk are led by IFNG pathway (Type II IFN). Single-cell correlates of inflamed cancers point to Type I IFNs, cytosolic nucleic acid sensing and inflammasome/IL-1B pathways. Therefore we profiled the effects of Type I IFN and IL-1B treatment as
well as activation of cytosolic DNA sensing machinery, in vitro, looking for a correlation between the treatment and gene response.
